        <h1>Ahri, Ionia</h1>
        <small>The Ninetailed Fox</small>
        <p>
          Innately connected to the latent power of
          Runeterra, Ahri is a vastaya who can reshape magic
          into orbs of raw energy. She revels in toying with
          her prey by manipulating their emotions before
          devouring their life essence. Despite her
          predatory nature, Ahri retains a sense of empathy
          as she receives flashes of memory from each soul
          she consumes.
        </p>

        <h3>Default Ahri Skin</h3>

        <p>
          Ahri sends out and pulls back her orb, dealing
          magic damage on the way out and true damage on the
          way back. Ahri gains a brief burst of movement
          speed and releases three fox-fires, that lock onto
          and attack nearby enemies. Ahri blows a kiss that
          damages and charms an enemy it encounters,
          instantly stopping movement abilities and causing
          them to walk harmlessly towards her. The target
          temporarily takes increased damage from Ahri. Ahri
          dashes forward and fires essence bolts, damaging
          nearby enemies. Spirit Rush can be cast up to
          three times before going on cooldown.
